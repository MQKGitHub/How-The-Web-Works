## 🌐 How The Web Works

This section of my TryHackMe learning journey dives into the **underlying functions of the web** — from DNS and HTTP to how websites are built and delivered. Understanding these systems is essential for spotting vulnerabilities and hacking effectively.

Each room breaks down a key part of how the internet works, with hands-on practice to reinforce concepts.

### 🧠 Overview

### 🌐 DNS in Detail  
- Learned how DNS translates domain names into IP addresses and how records like A, CNAME, MX, and TXT are used.  
- Explored the full journey of a DNS query, including recursive lookups, caching, and the role of authoritative name servers.

### 🔗 HTTP(S) in Detail
- Learned how HTTP and HTTPS work to transfer web data, and how URLs, headers, methods, and status codes structure communication between browsers and servers.  
- Explored how cookies, request/response formats, and encryption help manage sessions and keep data secure online.
